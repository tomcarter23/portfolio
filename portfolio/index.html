        <h1>Hi, I'm Tom!</h1>
        <p>I'm a Machine Learning Engineer based in London, passionate about building innovative AI-driven products.</p>
        <p>I earned my PhD in Experimental Particle Physics at the University of Edinburgh, working with CERN. My research focused on developing proprietary neural networks to conduct precision measurements of the Higgs boson, and modernising simulation tools using generative AI.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I have a passion for skiing — especially ski touring and off-piste adventures. I’m also a Level 2 Austrian-qualified ski instructor.</p>
